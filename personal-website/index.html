    <h2>Projects</h2>
    <h3>Personal Website on AWS</h3>
    <p>This project is designed to deploy a static website involves not just creating HTML, CSS, and JavaScript 
        files but also leveraging cloud-based tools to enhance the speed, reliability, and efficiency of 
        deployments. The cloud used in this project is Amazon Web Services (AWS), a leading cloud services 
        provider, offers a robust suite of tools that makes deploying, updating, and distributing static websites 
        straightforward. By using Amazon S3, a highly-scalable object storage service, developers can host their 
        static website assets with ease. But the true magic comes in with the integration of AWS CodePipeline, a 
        continuous integration and continuous deployment (CI/CD) service. With CodePipeline, every code update can be automatically deployed, ensuring 
        that the latest version of a website is always available to users. This not only removes manual deployment 
        processes but also significantly reduces the possibility of human error. This guide offers a step-by-step overview of harnessing the power of AWS for building 
        and deploying static websites.</p>

    <h3>Retail Store Clustering</h3>
    <p>The Retail Store Clustering project is designed to serve as a practical exploration to segment and cluster retail stores based on 
        various characteristics and performance metrics, with the aim of deriving meaningful insights for targeted marketing, inventory 
        management, and operational optimization.</p>

    <h3>Exploratory Data Analysis for Loan Repayment</h3>
    <p>The Loan Repayment project is designed to serve as a practical exploration of Machine Learning techniques to perform data preparation, 
        data exploration and data visualization to predic the loan risk or quality(loan repayment) on a given applicant.</p>

    <h3>Python projects</h3>
    <h4>Tic Tac Toe</h4>
    <p>Throughout the development of the Tic Tac Toe game, I ensured that the game flow is intuitive and error-free. Building this game was 
        not just about coding, but also about understanding game dynamics, user experience, and problem-solving.</p>

    <h4>Word Search</h4>
    <p>The inception of my Python adventure can be traced back to a class assignment,it was through the intriguing world of puzzles. 
        Specifically, the Word Search.</p>
